each moment passing by me
jeers its wicked smile of glee
yes, you may, help yourself
to verdict's venom 
is it heaven having freedom
nothing else?
fleeting life, a lone i 
while it takes, i fail to give
waiting to recognize 
no inscription
eulogy, just fiction

woe!
rue me!
i've seen it all before
gleefully ignored
imparity restored
i've seen it all before
 
eyes behold, even so the
answer lies unseen, ignored
cloudy film on my eyes
can't suspend
my disbelief
 
woe!
rue me!
i've seen it all before
gleefully ignored
imparity restored
i've seen it all before

when you tore out my heart
and you bore my child
who are you today?
who will you betray?
when you tore out my heart
and you bore my child
who are you today?
who will you betray?
 
swallow, don't you wallow now,
the bliss that mindfulness allows
the euphoria in me 
holier-than-thou!
wallow don't you swallow now
the bliss that idleness allows
phantasmagoria
in glee
for now
 
woe!
you, me!
i've seen it all before
gleefully ignored
imparity restored
i've seen it all, i've seen it all ...

i undress these wounds  
salt indecent sores
affection, subjection
no pleasure deplored
empty appetite for appetence
in consequence hester sins 
 
i lay you down, down, down, down
your body bound, bound, bound, bound
sense of self stripped and occupied
revel, gilded appetite
 
endless trial 
by ordeal
this jury is guilty
but shamed into apathy
lady justice shouldn’t have worn that dress
monthly cruentation, lolita confess
 
i lay you down, down, down, down
your body bound, bound, bound, bound
sense of self stripped and occupied
revel, gilded appetite

and all these witches are burning
sentenced to sorrow by yearning
a pyre stacked high on desire
lecherous flames, ever higher
 
violate, voluptuary
carmen dies defiantly
 
i lay you down, down, down, down
your body bound, bound, bound, bound
sense of self stripped and occupied
taste of guilt, blunt appetite
